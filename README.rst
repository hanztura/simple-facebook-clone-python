Simple Facebook Clone in Python
###############################

This project is part of a free guide on python programming for absolute beginners.

The goal of this project is to practice concepts learned on the said tutorial.

We will not be building a facebook clone that is as beautiful but complicated as the original Facebook.

What we will have is the simulation of basic facebook features and actions. These only include the following:
    - Sign up
    - Log in
    - Log out
    - Show friends list
    - Add a friend
